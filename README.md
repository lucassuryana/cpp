This is a repository of my learning experience with C++



How to use:
1. Open your IDE. In my case, I use Visual Code Studio
2. Clone this repository
3. Go to the folder where you want to test the code, i.e. BasicDataTypes
4. On your terminal type 'g++ main.cpp'
5. Check the result by typing './a.out'
