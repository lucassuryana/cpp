# cpp
This is a repository of my learning experience with C++



How to use:
1. Open your IDE. In my case, I use Visual Code Studio
2. Clone this repository
3. Go to the folder where you want to test the code, i.e. BasicDataTypes
4. On your terminal type 'g++ main.cpp'
5. Check the result by typing './a.out'

The advantages of C++ over Python:
1. In the case of a function, C++ is easier to debug. In C++, when we define a function, we need to define the data type for every input and output. On the other hand, Python is pretty loose in that we don't need to define the data type of the inputs and outputs. If we run a Python code that returns a list instead of a matrix, we only know the results after the code stops. Maybe it takes several hours to run the code. If we use C++, when the output type is not the same as the expected type, it will stop the program.
